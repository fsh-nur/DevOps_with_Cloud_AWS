# DevOps with Cloud Computing and AWS

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the collaboration of software development and operations, automating and integrating these two sectors, as a means to improve and streamline the development life cycle. 

## Benefits of DevOps

DevOps uses 4 main elements which are: 
- Tools

By using all four of these aspects in systems development DevOps has many benefits such as:

## What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of resources over the internet "cloud" as develeopers referred to it. Instead of storing data in hardware, such as data centers and servers, cloud computing provides this service to companies. 

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Advanced Security
- Easy to Use
- Pay As You Use
- Flexible 


## Why should we use it? 

- Cloud computing allows companies to manage data without the hassle and maintenance of building a physical IT infrastructure such as Data Centers
- Data Loss Prevention
- Allows quick response to change during periods of disruption
- Reduced carbon footprint
- Document Control

## Cloud and DevOps 

- Cloud computing is agile: DevOps teams can curate many cloud environments in minutes, and shut them down when no longer needed, instead of having to maintain physical IT infrastructures which would take more time.
- DevOps Automation: DevOps uses cloid systems such as Kubernetes where appls can be continuously integrated and deployed as well as monitored automatically.
- Serverless Computing: DevOps are able to build, deploy and operate serverless apps.

## How does it benefit the business?

- Disaster recovery
- Mobility
- Scalability
- Faster time to market
- Cost Effective
